Located south of the new bus stand in Pondicherry, the botanical garden was founded in 1826 and is another example of French influence in Pondicherry. The structure of the gate makes the whole place stand out in its otherwise Tamil town location. It was originally laid out in a typical French style garden, with gravel lined paths, pruned trees and fountains. The place features many different species of exotic plants and shrubs from all around the world. The place was turned into a botanical garden in 1931 by the French botanist and horticulturist George S. Perrottet. The garden also features a musical fountain which has two shows during evenings at the weekends.
